XML File Structure
==================

context = this is the scope where the text occurrs in the app UI
    name = this is the name of the context (do not translate)
    message
	   location = precise location of the localized text in the source code (do not translate)
	   translatorcomment = this is a note about translation meaning (do not translate)
-->    source = original wording (English)
-->    translation = this is Translated text  (place the translation of text in 'source' here)

What has to be done
===================

You need to translate the text from "source" to "translation" in the attached XML.

Notes
==================

1. Note, that value placeholders (%1, %2, etc.) have to be preserved in translated text. This is required for app functionality to work correctly.

2. If you translate XML file directly and do not use Qt Linquist make sure you handle XML correclty (i.e. &apos; &quot; &lt; &gt; has special meaning, it has to be preserved)

3. Some phrases will contain HTML formatting, like <i> (italic), <b> (bold). It has to be preserved. Note, that this formatting is intermixed with &lt; &gt; to escape special meaning of < and > characters in XML.  If you use Qt Linguist you do still need to preserve this HTML formatting.

4. Once you translate the text in 'translation', mark it as finished by removing ' type="unfinished"'.  Qt Linguist does this automatically.

5. Qt Linguist significanly simlifies the translation and rendering, you do not need to escape XML special charcaters, etc.  Consider it as a tool to use.

Example
=======

If you translate XML directly:

...
<context>
    <name>FilesList</name>
    <message>
        <location filename="../assets/FilesList.qml" line="13"/>
        <source>Select Songs</source>                                <---- translate this original
        <translation>Select Songs</translation>		                 <---- place translation here
    </message>
    <message>
        <location filename="../assets/FilesList.qml" line="77"/>
        <source>Play %1</source>                                         <---- translate this original
        <translation>Play %1</translation>                               <---- place translation here
    </message>
    <message>
        <location filename="../assets/FilesList.qml" line="118"/>
        <source>No songs in &apos;this&apos; directory</source>             <---- translate this original
        <translation>No songs in &apos;this&apos; directory</translation>   <---- place translation here
    </message>
</context>
...


Explanation
===========
Here we need to translate 3 phrases: "Select Songs", "Play %1" and "No songs in &apos;this&apos; directory".

The second phrase "Play %1" will traslate into "Играть %1" (in Russian, for example). Note, %1 is a placeholder that the app will substitute it with some value in run time. In the translation the order of %1 %2 may change depending on the target language grammar.

The last phrase contains the &apos; - it has to be preserved. For example, Russian translation will be "Нет песни в &apos;этом&apos; каталоге" (this => этом). If you use Qt 
Lingust it does that autimatically.
